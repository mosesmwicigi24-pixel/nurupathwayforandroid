# Parity Audit — backend truth → mobile apps (2026-07-04)

**Mandate** (owner's instruction, autonomous run): the database / backend / portal / iPad
are the reference. Every field and endpoint exists for a reason; trace that reason and
make the **Android and iOS member apps** reflect it. Never fix in a narrow window —
every change re-checks the whole flow of its page (DB → API → DTO → UI). Small commits,
every finding logged here with its trace and resolution, branches pushed + PRs opened.

**Method**: two read-only auditors diffed (A) backend wire truth (openapi + module
services) vs Android DTOs/renderers, and (B) iOS API consumption vs Android (iOS is
living proof of contract usage). Findings are fixed in ranked order; each fix is one
commit referenced below.

## Findings ledger

Status: ☐ open · ◐ in progress · ✅ fixed (commit) · ✖ rejected (reason)

| # | Area | Trace (wire truth → client state) | Resolution |
|---|------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | Event detail end time | CONFIRMED: GET /events/{id} has NO end on the wire (calendar/service.ts:868-926); end_at lives on /calendar occurrences. Passed as nav state (?end=) from every entry point; TIME tile + Add-to-calendar use it. Verified live: "9:00 AM – 1:00 PM". | ✅ 3e9f62f |
| 2 | Events "My RSVPs" | CONFIRMED: GET /me/rsvps (calendar/index.ts:76) → eventId→status map, as iOS quickRsvps. Wired: header "N you're going", segment count, tab filter. Verified live: 1 going / RSVPs=1 / Your RSVPs lists Sunday Service. | ✅ c7e9646 |
| 3 | Chat hub verse card | Wired to GET me/home/verse (TailoredVerse); static verse is now only the empty-response fallback. | ✅ 965088f |
| 4 | Settings 2FA state | Seeded from GET /me profile.mfa_enabled via LaunchedEffect. | ✅ 8d33050 |
| 5 | Profile field editing | iOS EditFieldSheet edits name/phone/dob/gender/country/city → backend endpoint exists; Android pencils are inert. Resolved via #10. | ✅ 7917aa7 |
| 6 | Prayer-wall reactions | CRITICAL bug found: server counts pray only for emoji=🙏 (service.ts PRAY const); Android sent literal "pray" → never counted. Fixed both call sites. Multi-emoji detail bar still open (→ #6b). | ✅ d72ad62 |
| 7 | Chat prayer chip | `ChatMessage.aiTag == "prayer"` → iOS shows "🙏 I'm praying" chip; Android ignores `aiTag`. Resolved via #14. | ✅ eabbeca |
| 8 | Radio extras | iOS radio uses reactions/chat/remind-me (verify endpoints); Android renders them inert. Resolved via #11. | ✅ d3616ec |

| 6b | Prayer detail 5-emoji reaction bar | Wire accepts arbitrary emoji; iOS detail shows 🙏❤️🕊️🙌✨ per-emoji chips from reactions[]. Verified live: 🙏2 ❤️3 highlighted as mine, rest neutral. | ✅ f7e805c |
| 9 | Giving receipt_code | financial/service.ts serves receipt_code on history+detail; DTOs dropped it. Statement "Ref …" line + receipt Reference now use it. | ✅ bf0bed2 |
| 10 | PATCH /me profile editing | identity/index.ts:160; body full_name/phone_number/gender/city/country_code/date_of_birth/… + row_version (strict zod — omit unset fields; explicit null rejected). iOS EditFieldSheet is the blueprint. Live verify caught: PATCH returns ONLY {user_id,row_version} (service.ts:670) — parse UpdateMeRes + refetch /me. Verified on emulator vs prod (City save round-trips clean, fresh row_version retained). | ✅ 7917aa7 + 7e82595 |
| 11 | Radio react/comments/program | radio/index.ts:163-177: react kind∈heart\|amen\|fire (+client_event_id) → {counts}; comments GET/POST; program GET. Verified live on air: heart tap → server counts 3/2/2 "7 reactions today"; comment "Amen from Android" posted + rendered from refetch with avatar. | ✅ d3616ec |
| 12 | giving/paypal/capture | MemberAPI+Ops.swift:16 → POST {order_id} → {status}; without it PayPal gifts never settle on Android. "I've approved — confirm gift" button on GiveResult calls capture with the order ref. | ✅ 7aaa4e9 |
| 13 | POST /auth/logout | refresh-token revocation on sign-out (security); Android sign-out was local-only. AuthStore.signOut now revokes best-effort (never blocks local sign-out). | ✅ c989178 |
| 14 | Chat prayer chip (ai_tag) | ChatMessage.ai_tag=="prayer" → iOS PrayerChip; Android decoded aiTag but never rendered. Chip shows "🙏 I'm praying"/"🙏 Praying · N" and posts the 🙏 reaction. | ✅ eabbeca |
| 15 | Chat send attachments/replies | Re-traced: the send-schema extras are exercised by the STAFF broadcast path (iOS broadcast composer + portal), not member send — iOS member send is text-only too (MemberAPI.swift:534), so the clients are parity-equal. Received image attachments already render on both (ChatThreadScreen:312 / ChatThreadView:771). last_duration previews voice notes no client can send. Member-side attachment/reply/voice send → backlog #20 as a feature build, not a parity gap. | ✖ parity-equal (→ #20) |
| 16 | UserProfile drops socials/account_status/role_keys | identity/service.ts getMe serves socials/account_status/require_2fa/created_at/role_keys; client dropped all. Now decoded (require_2fa via @SerialName — digit defeats the snake-case strategy). PATCH-loss risk was already avoided by the JsonObject body. | ✅ ad55e82 |
| 17 | EventDetail images[] gallery | wire returns images[]=[primary,…gallery]; Android showed primary only. Gallery strip card renders images[1:]; compile-verified (no gallery data in prod yet — decode-safe default). | ✅ aa82f79 |
| 18 | Calendar occurrence status/rescheduled | projectRange drops cancelled occurrences; moved ones carry rescheduled=true with new start/end applied. RESCHEDULED pill (top-end of card cover) surfaces it; compile-verified (no moved occurrence in prod yet — decode-safe default). | ✅ 1856c94 |
| 19 | Prayer audio_waveform | posts+comments carry audio_url+audio_waveform. Re-traced vs iOS: NO client renders the waveform — iOS shows a passive "Voice prayer" tag when audio_url is set (PrayerWallView.voiceTag). Android now matches. Waveform render + playback → backlog #20. | ✅ 16657cd |
| 20 | Smaller adds | verse reactions (home/index.ts:38,43) · giving statement/receipt PDFs · /me/home/greeting · /badges catalogue · /scripture lookup · share-prayer-to-wall · /home/featured-event · TailoredVerse.mood · cert PDF authed fetch · screen telemetry · chat broadcast+attachments sign (staff) · community threads · /me/discipleship. | ☐ backlog |

## Live verification (emulator vs prod, 2026-07-04)

- Events: header "1 you're going" · RSVPs segment [1] · Your RSVPs lists Sunday Service · TIME "9:00 AM – 1:00 PM".
- Profile: City edit sheet opens seeded ("Nairobi"), Save round-trips PATCH /me → refetch, sheet dismisses clean.
- Radio (on air, "Night Worship hour"): heart react → server aggregate counts ❤️3 🙏2 🙌2 ("7 reactions today"); comment "Amen from Android" posted and re-rendered from the server with author name + avatar.
- Prayer detail: 5-emoji bar live — 🙏2 ❤️3 rendered gold (mine=true from the wire), 🕊️🙌✨ neutral; wall list "2 praying" confirms the Wave-1 🙏 fix is counting.

## iOS mini-pass (nuru-member-ios, 2026-07-04)

Auditor's "iOS lags" list re-checked against the code — most items were already
covered (peerUserId → createDm; ChatPerson flair renders in ChatView; radio
reconciles POST /react counts). Real gaps found + fixed (commit `41cb7fc`,
pushed to main with the stranded discipleship commit `0b39f72`):

- EventDetail never decoded `images[]` and never rendered `videoUrl` (model
  field existed, view ignored it) → gallery rail + universal-player video tile.
- CalendarOccurrence didn't decode `status`/`rescheduled` → RESCHEDULED gold
  pill in the card's status slot (same slot as LIVE / "Filling fast").
- PATCH /me response shape checked: iOS decodes `EmptyResponse` + refetches via
  auth.loadProfile() — already safe; only Android had the MeResponse mis-typing.

`xcodebuild` simulator build green.
